# Testimonial Slider

## Description

This is a challenge provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). And this is one of the many solutions availables. If you want to see any other solution, please refreer to the official website.

Since this is just a sample, I think there are no contributions to do here, and I think I won't update this unless find new interesting things for animations or to improve the JS code.

If you want to place a comment on the code, please feel free to do it, feedback is always welcome ðŸ˜‰ but I encourage you to try to do this challenge by your own, trust me, it's very helpful and teaches you a couple of things.

Also, you can fork this repo if you find it useful, but it's better to start from the scratch, either way, do it whatever make you feel more comfortable.
